Tl,DR

Backfeed is building a minable token on a system which hopes to award positive contributions to discussions which we all assume might help us self organize across an organization this size. The main element of this proposal is a Reputation system which increases based on a median of all Agents whom go with the flow of the many and do it before it becomes the norm. I picture this implemented in a centralized website like daohub(?)
